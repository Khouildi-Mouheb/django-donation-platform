# django-donation-platform
Django Donation Cycle is a web platform managing the full lifecycle of donations. Participants propose, Membres validate or refuse, Transporteurs handle logistics, and donations are added to stock. From there, people in need can browse available items and submit demands, ensuring donations reach those who need them most.
